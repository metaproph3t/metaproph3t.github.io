    <h2>Do we need money anymore?</h2>
    <p>
	People use money for a few reasons. For one, it allows them to store
	purchasing power. A baker can sell bread today and buy meat tomorrow. 
	Money also gives people a unit of account in which to price goods and
	investments. 

    <p>
	Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tend to be split on how money should look
	in the future. Some advocate for a 
	<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2021e3.htm">synthetic commodity money</a>,
	like
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">BTC</a>,
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>,
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">SOL</a>,
	or even <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/">DOGE</a>.
	Proponents

	<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">money</a>. On the other
	hand, others say that assets like BTC are far too volatile to be used
	by normal people, and that people should instead use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin">stablecoins</a>
	that are either pegged to <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">individual fiat currencies</a>,
	<a href="https://sls.gmu.edu/pfrt/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/LibraWhitePaper_en_US-Rev0723.pdf">a basket of currencies</a>,
	or <a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/">a basket of assets</a>.
	People who use these tokens will be able to get the benefits of blockchains
	(e.g., programmable contracts, instant global payments, etc.) without
	incurring market risk, or so they say.

    <p>
	What if they're all wrong? What if currency doesn't have a future?
	And no, I'm not being provocative for the sake of being provocative.
	Please allow me a brief moment to explain.

    <h3>The general idea</h3>

    <p>
	As stated in the
	<a href="https://assets.website-files.com/611153e7af981472d8da199c/618b02d13e938ae1f8ad1e45_Terra_White_paper.pdf">Terra Whitepaper</a>,
	"Currencies inherently have strong network effects:
	a customer is unlikely to switch over to a new currency unless a critical
	mass of merchants are
	ready to accept it, but at the same time, merchants have no reason to
	invest resources and educate
	staff to accept a new currency unless there is significant customer
	demand for it." This is the premise upon which all currencies are based.
	When I walk into a store, I need to be carrying the currency that a merchant
	will accept. If I try to pay with Euros in an American supermarket, I'm
	going to have a tough time.

    <p>
	Or am I? Most debit and credit cards allow you to make free or very cheap
	(~1% fees) international purchases. So someone walking into an American
	supermarket with only Euros (in their bank account) would be okay: Visa or Mastercard
	will <a href="https://www.helcim.com/guides/accepting-international-credit-cards/">convert currencies in the back-end</a>
	so that I can pay in Euros and the merchant can get paid in US Dollars.
	This generalizes to assets stored on blockchains as well.
	<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/card">Coinbase Card</a>, for example,
	allows you to spend using crypto. PayPal
	<a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/pay-with-crypto-using-paypal-heres-how/">allows you to pay with crypto in checkout</a>.
	From a technical implementation perspective, it should be trivial for
	these firms to allow users to pay using other blockchain-based assets.

    <p>
	Now look at an asset class that has
	<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031015/what-history-futures.asp">existed since the 16th centry</a>
	and is <a href="https://blog.landx.fi/landx-roadmap-7f45945ba748">starting to move onto blockchains</a>:
	commodity futures. Commodity futures are simply a way to buy a good
	before that good has been produced. For example, if I am a chicken
	farmer and you are McDonalds,
	<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/how-ray-dalio-helped-launch-mcdonalds-chicken-mcnugget.html">I can pre-sell you a quantity of chickens before I have raised them</a>.

    <p>
	While neither of these above ideas - paying with crypto and commodities
	futures - is particularly exciting by itself, paring them together might
	eliminate the need for money.
