    <h2>DeFi: The 10,000 Foot View</h2>
    <p>
    	In November 1910, a group of six powerful men met at a country club in
	Georgia. Their conference was most secretly-guarded: the men didn't publicly
	admit that it had happened until 20 years later. We might even call it
	a conspiracy. As far as conspiracies go, this one turned out to be fairly
	important: it
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island#Planning_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System</a>,
	which in turn became the world's de facto banking system.

    <p>
    	We are in the midst of another conspiracy. This one is similar in intent
	- reshape the way that the financial system works - but different in character.
	Instead of 6 powerful American men, it's
	<a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">thousands of people from all over the world</a>.
	Many of these people would be considered outsiders in normal society, with
	their <a href="https://twitter.com/vec0zy/status/1681286797597323265?s=20">strange mannerisms</a>
	and their <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1681850784282193920?s=20">spouting of technobabble that seems to be a language into iself</a>.
	Instead of meetings at country clubs, they coordinate over <a href="https://hackmd.io/">hackmds</a>,
	<a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram group chats</a>, and
	<a href="https://solana.com/breakpoint">conference presentations</a>.
	<a href="https://youtu.be/urtXRg9Nl3k">Many of them opt to be pseudonymous</a>, including myself.
	And so far, their plan appears to be working: <a href="https://defillama.com/">$45B has already migrated</a>
	to the system they've created.

    <p>
    	To be sure, $45B is a small amount when compared to
	<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-wealth-in-one-visualization/">the world's wealth, which stands at about $400T</a>.
	But it's a start. And it's a hell of a lot more than $200M, which is what it was
	4 years ago in 2019. In fact, DeFi usage is
	<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html">growing about as fast as internet bandwidth usage grew in the 1990s</a>.
	I believe that this growth trajectory will continue, and that any capital
	allocator stands to achieve outsized returns by investing in the DeFi
	landscape. This is why:

    <h3>An opportunity to be the next global financial system</h3>
    <p>
	<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization">We live in an increasingly globalized world</a>.
	And yet our financial systems have yet to catch up. It is still
	<i>hard, slow, and expensive</i> to do the following things:
	<li>
		<ul>send assets to people in other jurisdictions
		<ul>exchange currencies
		<ul>directly purchase securities that have issuers outside of your jurisdiction
		<ul>invest in funds that are operated outside of your jurisdiction
	</li>

    <p>
    	It is not hard to understand why. Each country has its own financial system,
	which can be understood as the combination of two ledgers: the money ledger,
	maintained by the central bank, and the financial instrument ledger, managed
	by a tighly-regulated securities depository like
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation">DTCC</a>.
	Things are a little bit more complicated than this - for example, the US actually
	has 2 main financial instrument ledgers, since the Fed clears government securities -
	but this is the 10,000 foot view, right? Anyways, as any distributed systems engineer
	knows, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">these types of ledgers can only have one source of truth</a>.
	What this means in practice is that
	<i>money or financial instruments cannot flow across borders</i>. US dollars
	cannot be stored on the Bank of England's ledger, nor can Indian Rupees be
	stored on the Fed's ledger. If you want to interact with the currency or
	financial instruments of a given jurisdiction, you must create an account with
	that jurisdiction's ledger(s) or with someone else who has access to the ledger
	(e.g., a bank, a broker, a payment processor, et cetera). 

    <p>
    	Now, given that there are 196 countries it would obviously be crazy for
	people to create an account with <i>every</i> ledger. So historically,
	we've managed this by using a common hub: the US financial system. 
	<a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Data/Statistics/BPM6/CATT/c3-international-trade-classified-by-currency.ashx">The vast
	majority of international trade, other than between EU member states, happens
	in US dollars</a>. And the vast majority of the world's equities are purchasable
	by American brokers, either because the company has listed on an American exchange
	or via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt">American depository receipts (ADRs)</a>.
	If you're a Saudi oil tycoon who wants to buy Nintendo stock, you trade will
	probably never touch Tokyo; instead, you will use US dollars to buy Nintendo
	ADRs through an NYC-based broker.
