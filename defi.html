    <h2>DeFi is gud</h2>

    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
    	In November 1910, a group of six powerful men met at a country club in
	Georgia. Their conference was most secretly-guarded: the men didn't publicly
	admit that it had happened until 20 years later. We might even call it
	a *conspiracy*. As far as conspiracies go, this one turned out to be fairly
	important: it
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island#Planning_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System</a>,
	which in turn became the world's de facto banking system.

    <p>
    	We are in the midst of another conspiracy. This one is similar in intent
	- reshape the way that the financial system works - but different in character.
	Instead of 6 powerful American men, it's
	<a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">thousands of people from all over the world</a>.
	Many of these people would be considered outsiders in normal society, with
	their <a href="https://twitter.com/vec0zy/status/1681286797597323265?s=20">strange mannerisms</a>
	and their <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1681850784282193920?s=20">spouting of technobabble that seems to be a language into iself</a>.
	Instead of meetings at country clubs, they coordinate over <a href="https://hackmd.io/">hackmds</a>,
	<a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram group chats</a>, and
	<a href="https://solana.com/breakpoint">conference presentations</a>.
	<a href="https://youtu.be/urtXRg9Nl3k">Many of them opt to be pseudonymous</a>, including myself.
	And so far, their plan appears to be working: <a href="https://defillama.com/">$45B has already migrated</a>
	to the system they've created.

    <p>
    	To be sure, $45B is a small amount when compared to the world's wealth
	<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-wealth-in-one-visualization/">which stands at ~$400T</a>.
	But it's a start. And it's a hell of a lot more than $200M, which is what it was
	4 years ago. In fact, DeFi usage is
	<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html">growing about as fast as internet bandwidth usage grew in the 1990s</a>.
	I believe that this growth trajectory will continue, and that any investor
	stands to achieve outsized returns by investing in the DeFi
	landscape. This is why:

    <h3>An opportunity to be the next global financial system</h3>
    <p>
	<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization">We live in an increasingly globalized world</a>.
	And yet our financial systems have yet to catch up. It is still
	<i>hard, slow, and expensive</i> to do the following things:
	<ul>
		<li>send assets to people in other jurisdictions</li>
		<li>exchange currencies</li>
		<li>directly purchase securities that have issuers outside of your jurisdiction</li>
		<li>invest in funds that are operated outside of your jurisdiction</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
    	The problem <i>is not</i> that we don't have enough Fintechs; these are
	issues intrinsic to the most basic layer of our financial systems. See,
	if you've mucked around in the plumbing of the financial system
	you understand a few basic realities:
	<ul>
		<li>Each country has its own financial system.</li>
		<li>A financial system is really just a combination of ledgers.
		For example, the US financial system is four ledgers:
		<a href="https://app.frbservices.org/financial-services/wires/index.html">Fedwire Funds</a>,
		which keeps track of money;
		<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/securities/">Fedwire Securities Service</a>,
		which keeps track of government bonds; 
		<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/">CME</a>,
		which keeps track of options and futures (as well as being an
		exchange for them); and
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation">DTCC</a>,
		which keeps track of all other securities such as equities,
		corporate bonds, money markets, and investment trusts.
		<li>These ledgers do not nor can they interoperate. US Dollars
		cannot be stored on the Bank of England's ledger. Indian Rupees
		cannot be stored on the Fed's ledger.</li>
	</ul>
	This last point is very important. It means that <i>assets cannot move
	across borders</i>, and that any attempt to do so will be hacky and
	probably expensive (see:
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondent_account">correspondent banking</a>).
	This is why global financial transactions suck.

    <p>
    	Since assets can't move across borders, how do people financially
	interact with people in a different country than their own?
    	Given that there are 196 countries it would obviously be crazy for
	people to create an account with <i>every</i> ledger. So historically,
	we've gotten around this by using a common hub: the US financial system.
	Case in point:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Data/Statistics/BPM6/CATT/c3-international-trade-classified-by-currency.ashx">
		We do the vast majority of our international trade in US dollars</a>.</li>
		<li>Many companies outside the US list exclusively on US exchanges,
		such as Spotify (NYSE: SPOT), Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), 
		and Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM).</li>
		<li>Many more, such as Alibaba, SAP, and AstraZeneca either
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_listing">cross-list</a>
		their shares on US exchanges or have
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt">American depository receipts (ADRs)</a>,
		trading in the US markets.</li>
	</ul>
	This way, you don't have to create accounts all over the world. You just
	have to create accounts in your home country and in 'Murica. 
	If you're a Saudi oil tycoon who wants
	to buy shares of Nintendo, your order will probably never touch Tokyo.
	Instead, you will use US dollars to buy Nintendo ADRs 
	through an NYC-based broker.

    <p>
    	This system is okay-ish, but it won't continue into the future.
	Instead, DeFi will usurp the US's position and become a
	<a href="https://twitter.com/zxocw/status/1569462437560332288?s=20">unified global financial system</a>.
	Don't believe me? Good! Let's go over the reasons why this is the case:
	<ul>
	<li>At a macro level, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/07/america-is-too-scared-of-the-multipolar-world/">we're moving from a unipolar to a multipolar world</a>. <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-share-of-global-economy-over-time/">US GDP as a percentage of global GDP has been shrinking since the 1960s</a>.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">Populism</a>
	and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/">conflict at home</a> reduce America's global prestige.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Former allies are teaming up with competing world powers</a>. Platform Americana is losing its grip.</li>
	<li>Although institutions and high-net-worth individuals around the world
	have good connectivity to the US financial system, most normal people don't.
	This is important in a world that is <a href="https://www.bnymellonwealth.com/insights/the-rise-of-retail-traders.html">increasingly dominated by retail (as opposed to institutional) investors</a>.</li>
	<li>Public blockchains are intrinsically better ledgers than the ones
	provided by the US financial system. DeFi applications are intrinsically
	better than TradFi services. Specifically,<ul>
		<li>The US financial system works from 9:30 am to 4 pm EST.
		Public blockchains work 24/7.</li>
		<li>The US financial system settles transactions on the order
		of days. Public blockchains settle transactions on the
		order of seconds or minutes, depending on the chain.</li>
		<li>The US financial system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis">is opaque</a>. DeFi <a href="https://solscan.io/block/207680427">is open</a>.</li>
		<li>The US financial system requires a good deal of trust.
		You need to trust your banker, your broker, your custodian,
		your central banker, your exchange, your central securities
		depository, and on and on and on. Although blow-ups due to
		fraud are relatively uncommon, when they happen customers can
		lose a substantial portion of or all of their capital. This
		introduces transaction costs. Public blockchains and DeFi
		applications are generally designed to be trustless.</li>
		<li>The US financial system is still somewhat manual. Although
		it has become more automated over time, especially over the
		last 20 years, there are still far too many NYC and New Jersey
		residents working for the proverbial 'back office.' Many important
		actions require you to call someone or send something in the mail.
		DeFi is almost completely automatic. Many of the fundamental 
		applications like AMMs (automated market-makers, e.g., Uniswap) 
		and CLOBs (central-limit order books, e.g., OpenBook, formerly Serum)
		require no human intervention. No mailing or calling required.</li>
		<li>The US financial system is boring and ugly. Try using your
		electronic brokerage after you use <a href="https://jup.ag/">Jupiter</a>
		or <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>. It feel nice?</li>
		<li>The US financial system <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPFI">is expensive</a>.
		DeFi can be extremely cheap to use, depending on the chain.</li>
		<li>The US financial system has a good deal of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a>.
		This makes it harder for upstarts to compete, which in turn
		causes many of the above problems.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Importantly, because it is based on a decentralized blockchain, DeFi
	is credibly-neutral. This means, for example, that someone cannot 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran">force
	the Iranians out of the system</a> simply because 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">one person or polity has decided that they should be ejected</a>. This credible-neutrality also
	reflects in DeFi's optics. Some DeFi applications are built by traditional
	'Silicon Valley' people in San Francisco, but many are built by people
	who reside outside the US. The blockchain is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-and-china-more-than-meets-the-eye-1376954038">
	as much China's as it is America's</a>.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
    	Most arguments against DeFi boil down to 'it would be great, but the
	existing system already kinda works, so it will probably work into the
	future.' If you believe this, I implore you to try the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Gather up some friends</li>
		<li>Return to the caves that your ancestors lived in</li>
		<li>Spend your time trying to gather food and avoid being eaten
		by lions</li>
		<li>See how long you can last before you yearn to return to modern
		civilization</li>
	</ul>
	Don't wanna try it? Okay, you can take my work that progress is good
	and humans eventually move to things that serve them better.

    <h3>How we get there</h3>

    <p>
    	Still, there is the question of how we get there. I think DeFi will
	need to go through three stages in order to become the world's global
	financial system:
	<ol>
		<li>Build primitives</li>
		<li>Onboard assets</li>
		<li>Onboard users</li>
	</ol>
	It doesn't make a ton of sense to market DeFi until the primitives
	have been built and the assets have been onboarded. That would be like
	marketing Uber before the app has been built or any drivers have joined.
	Right now, we're in the latter part of the primitive-building stage.
	Many of the fundamental primitives, such as order books and money markets,
	have been built but there are still some open problems like:
	<ul>
		<li>How do we build an undercollateralized lending platform?
		Can we ascribe credit scores in a pseudonymous system?</li>
		<li>How should we manage governance of DeFi applications, given
		that simple token-voting clearly doesn't work?</li>
		<li>How should a stablecoin work? Can we make a resilient,
		decentralized, capital-efficient stablecoin?</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
    	We are starting to see some grass shoots in the onboarding assets arena.
	Of course, USD-based stablecoins have existed for a while, but we're
	starting to see stablecoins for other currencies such as
	<a href="https://www.circle.com/en/euro-coin">Euros</a>,
	<a href="https://www.gmo.jp/en/news/article/821/">Yen</a>,
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/22/tether-stablecoin-tied-to-pound-uk-crypto-currency">Pounds</a>,
	<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/circle-kucoin-chinese-yuan-stablecoin/">Yuan</a>, 
	<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/anz-becomes-first-australian-bank-mint-stablecoin-2022-03-23/">Australian Dollars</a>, and 
	<a href="https://www.getcadc.com/">Canadian Dollars</a>. <i>It won't
	be long before FX trading is easier, cheaper, and faster for most people
	in DeFi than in TradFi</i>. Aside from currencies, we've seen projects
	like <a href="https://www.maple.finance/">Maple</a>
	and <a href="https://goldfinch.finance/">Goldfinch</a> onboard debt
	into DeFi. How many years will it be before trading
	stocks and bonds is easier in DeFi than in TradFi?

    <h3>How you can benefit</h3>

    <p>
    	Of course, this is early days, and who knows what will end up working?
	<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/29/who-got-rich-before-terra-stablecoin-collapsed.html">Lots of smart people
	thought Terra's UST would work</a>, but <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terraclassicusd">it didn't</a>.

    <p>
	The upshot is that if you use either the history of cryptocurrency or
	technology as a guide, the bets that pay off
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Shriram">have a chance of delivering up to 1,000x - 10,000x returns</a>.
    	What I personally follow (of course, not financial advice) is a 'spray and pray'
	approach, where I allocate small amounts of money to many projects
	that I think might work. That way, my downside from any individual
	project failing is small, but my potential upside is still large enough
	that I can rationally believe that I have a shot of beating market returns.
