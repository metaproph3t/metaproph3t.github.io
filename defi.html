    <h2>DeFi: The 10,000 Foot View</h2>
    <p>
    	In November 1910, a group of six powerful men met at a country club in
	Georgia. Their conference was most secretly-guarded: the men didn't publicly
	admit that it had happened until 20 years later. We might even call it
	a conspiracy. As far as conspiracies go, this one turned out to be fairly
	important: it
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island#Planning_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System</a>,
	which in turn became the world's de facto banking system.

    <p>
    	We are in the midst of another conspiracy. This one is similar in intent
	- reshape the way that the financial system works - but different in character.
	Instead of 6 powerful American men, it's
	<a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">thousands of people from all over the world</a>.
	Many of these people would be considered outsiders in normal society, with
	their <a href="https://twitter.com/vec0zy/status/1681286797597323265?s=20">strange mannerisms</a>
	and their <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1681850784282193920?s=20">spouting of technobabble that seems to be a language into iself</a>.
	Instead of meetings at country clubs, they coordinate over <a href="https://hackmd.io/">hackmds</a>,
	<a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram group chats</a>, and
	<a href="https://solana.com/breakpoint">conference presentations</a>.
	<a href="https://youtu.be/urtXRg9Nl3k">Many of them opt to be pseudonymous</a>, including myself.
	And so far, their plan appears to be working: <a href="https://defillama.com/">$45B has already migrated</a>
	to the system they've created.

    <p>
    	To be sure, $45B is a small amount when compared to
	<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-wealth-in-one-visualization/">the world's wealth, which stands at about $400T</a>.
	But it's a start. And it's a hell of a lot more than $200M, which is what it was
	4 years ago in 2019. In fact, DeFi usage is
	<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html">growing about as fast as internet bandwidth usage grew in the 1990s</a>.
	I believe that this growth trajectory will continue, and that any capital
	allocator stands to achieve outsized returns by investing in the DeFi
	landscape. This is why:

    <h3>An opportunity to be the next global financial system</h3>
    <p>
	<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization">We live in an increasingly globalized world</a>.
	And yet our financial systems have yet to catch up. It is still
	<i>hard, slow, and expensive</i> to do the following things:
	<li>
		<ul>send assets to people in other jurisdictions</ul>
		<ul>exchange currencies</ul>
		<ul>directly purchase securities that have issuers outside of your jurisdiction</ul>
		<ul>invest in funds that are operated outside of your jurisdiction</ul>
	</li>

    <p>
    	Why is this the case? The reason why is surprisingly straightforward.
	See, every country has its own financial system, each of which is
	comprised of two ledgers: the money ledger and the financial instrument
	ledger. The money ledger tracks ownership of money (the proverbial
	'liabilities of the central bank,' whatever the fuck that means) and
	the financial instrument ledger tracks things like stocks, bonds, and
	derivatives. Sometimes, things are a bit more complicated than this -
	for example, the US 'financial instrument ledger' is really two ledgers:
	<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/securities/">Fedwire Securities Service</a>,
	which tracks government bonds, and
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation">DTCC</a>,
	which keeps track of everything else - but it's still useful to think
	of financial systems as a combination of money ledger and financial
	instrument ledger, managed or regulated by the nation-state. The implication
	of this is that <i>money or financial instruments cannot flow across borders</i>.
	US Dollars cannot be stored on the Bank of England's ledger, nor can 
	Indian Rupees be stored on the Fed's ledger. Any asset can only exist
	in canonical form in the jurisdiction where that asset is minted. 

    <p>
    	Now, given that there are 196 countries it would obviously be crazy for
	people to create an account with <i>every</i> ledger. So historically,
	we've managed this by using a common hub: the US financial system.
	<a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Data/Statistics/BPM6/CATT/c3-international-trade-classified-by-currency.ashx">
	We do the vast majority of our international trade in US dollars</a>.
	Many companies outside the US list exclusively on US exchanges, such as
	Spotify (NYSE: SPOT), Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM).
	Many more, such as Alibaba, SAP, and AstraZeneca either
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_listing">cross-list</a>
	their shares on US exchanges or have
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt">American depository receipts (ADRs)</a>
	trading in the US markets. The effect of all of this is that if you're
	a Saudi oil tycoon who wants to buy Nintendo stock, your trade will
	probably never touch Tokyo; instead, you will use US dollars to buy Nintendo
	ADRs through an NYC-based broker.

    <p>
    	DeFi aims to usurp this position. It has a good chance of doing so for
	the following reasons:
	<li>
	<ul>At a macro level, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/07/america-is-too-scared-of-the-multipolar-world/">we're moving from a unipolar to a multipolar world</a>. <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-share-of-global-economy-over-time/">US GDP as a percentage of global GDP has been shrinking since the 1960s</a>.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">Populism</a>
	and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/">conflict at home</a> spell a shift away from foreign policy in the
	American politician's brain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Former allies are teaming up with competing world powers</a>. Platform Americana is losing its grip.</ul>
	<ul>Although institutions and high-net-worth individuals around the world
	have good connectivity to the US financial system, most normal people don't.
	This is important in a world that is <a href="https://www.bnymellonwealth.com/insights/the-rise-of-retail-traders.html">increasingly dominated by retail (as opposed to institutional) investors</a></ul>.
	<ul>Public blockchains are intrinsically better ledgers than the ones
	provided by the US financial system. DeFi applications are intrinsically
	better than TradFi services. Specifically,
		<ul>The US financial system works from 9:30 am to 4 pm EST.
			Public blockchains work 24/7.</ul>
		<ul>The US financial system settles transactions on the order
			of days. Public blockchains settle transactions on the
			order of seconds or minutes, depending on the chain.</ul>
		<ul>The US financial system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis">is opaque</a>. DeFi <a href="https://solscan.io/block/207680427">is open</a></ul>.
		<ul>The US financial system requires a good deal of trust.
		You need to trust your banker, your broker, your custodian,
		your central banker, your exchange, your central securities
		depository, and on and on and on. Although blow-ups due to
		fraud are relatively uncommon, when they happen customers can
		lose a substantial portion of or all of their capital. This
		introduces transaction costs. Public blockchains and DeFi
		applications are generally designed to be trustless.</ul>
		<ul>The US financial system is still somewhat manual. Although
		it has become more automated over time, especially over the
		last 20 years, there are still far too many NYC and New Jersey
		residents working for the proverbial 'back office.' Many important
		actions require you to call someone or send something in the mail.
		DeFi is almost completely automatic. Many of the fundamental 
		applications like AMMs (automated market-makers, e.g., Uniswap) 
		and CLOBs (central-limit order books, e.g., OpenBook, formerly Serum)
		require no human intervention. No mailing or calling required.</ul>
		<ul>The US financial system is boring and ugly. Try using your
		electronic brokerage after you use <a href="https://jup.ag/">Jupiter</a>
		or <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>. It feel nice?</ul>
		<ul>The US financial system <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPFI">is expensive</a>.
		DeFi can be extremely cheap to use, depending on the chain</ul>.
		<ul>The US financial system has a good deal of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a>.
		This makes it harder for upstarts to compete, which in turn
		causes many of the above problems.</ul></ul>
	<ul>Importantly, because it is based on a decentralized blockchain, DeFi
	is credibly-neutral. This means, for example, that someone cannot force
	the Iranians out of the system simply because one person or polity has
	decided that they should be ejected. This credible-neutrality also
	reflects in DeFi's optics. Some DeFi applications are built by traditional
	'Silicon Valley' people in San Francisco, but most are built by people
	who reside outside the US.</ul>
