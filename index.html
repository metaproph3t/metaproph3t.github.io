    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        I am an anonymous developer building on the <a href="https://solanabeach.io/">Solana blockchain</a>. 
	Before anonymity, I worked for some prominent DeFi DAOs on Ethereum.
	Before that, I was a software engineer in web2.

    <p>
	I'm pretty sick of the way organizations work today. Too much empire-building
	and image-managing, not enough work being done. I didn't want to be a
	part of that anymore, so I started researching and thinking about
	alternative forms of organizing.

    <p>
	The result of this navel-gazing is <a href="themetadao.org">the Meta-DAO</a>.
	The Meta-DAO will be an experimental organization, organized as a DAO
	on Solana. It will use <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">futarchy</a>,
	along with some <a href="https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf">other novel mechanisms</a>,
	to make decisions. 

    <p>
	As you might expect from the name, the Meta-DAO will be
	comprised of many <i>member DAOs</i>, each of which manages a single
	product or service. At the start, these will be Solana DeFi applications.
	I'm going to build an ETF-like product as a member. If you're really
	cool, you might even consider building your next DeFi project as a member!
