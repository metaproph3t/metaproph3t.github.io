    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hello there! For some reason, you have stumbled upon my website.
        While you are here, I will regale you with my story.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="pfp.png" width="150">

    </div>

    <p>
        I am an anonymous developer building on the <a href="https://solanabeach.io/">Solana blockchain</a>. 
	Before anonymity, I worked for some prominent DeFi DAOs on Ethereum.
	Before that, I was a software engineer in web2.

    <p>
        While working for these organizations, I often felt malaise. It was
        uncomfortable to see decisions being made for reasons 
        orthogonal to the organization's interests. For example, the web2 hiring managers 
        tended to hire more engineers than they needed simply to bolster their 
        own status (after all, "managed a team of 2,000" is much more impressive than 
        "managed a team of 2," even if the first costs 1,000x more).
        And at the DAOs, I found that decisions were often made based on popularity contests
        rather than pros and cons lists.

    <p>
	Worse still, I felt <i>myself</i> being pulled in to this way of doing 
	things. I was gradually learning that the best
	way to get ahead is to make your boss(es) happy, not necessarily what is
	in the group's interest. I was like one of those Soviet bureaucrats who
    figured out that if you're put in charge of chandelier production and your
    production is estimated by tonnage, the best course of action is to produce 
    chandeliers so heavy "that they pull the ceilings down on our 
	heads," in the words of Khruschev</a>. And I desparately did not want to
    become a Soviet bureaucrat. 

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="soviet_nail.png" width="200">
    <p>'You measured our output by tonnage. What did you expect?'
    </p>
    </div>


    <p>
    	So, I decided to build an alternative organization. One where
	incentives were aligned such that someone maximizing for their own
	interest would produce a socially-beneficial outcome.
	<i>This</i> would be an organization that I would want to work for.

    <p>
    	When I started exploring the design space, I thought I might be able
        to create such an organization with clever financial engineering.
        Maybe, for example, we could give decision-makers financial instruments
        that give them upside proportional to how well their decisions turns out.
        But for reasons of game theory, this was a dead end.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="options_compensation.jpeg" width="500">
    <p>Even with balooning incentivization compensation, CEOs and
        professional managers' incentives are often insufficiently
        aligned with those of the shareholders. If anything, CEOs
        are paid too little, not too much!
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
    	So I turned to more untested designs. One that
	    captivated my attention was <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">futarchy</a>. 
        In a futarchy, markers make decisions, not appointed decision-makers. An ardent believer in
	markets, I started thinking about how futarchy could be implemented.

    <p>
    	The result of this navel-gazing is <a href="themetadao.org">the Meta-DAO</a>.
	If all goes according to plan, the Meta-DAO will be an organization on
	Solana that uses futarchy, along with some <a href="https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf">other novel mechanisms</a>,
    to make decisions. As you might expect from the name, the Meta-DAO will be
	comprised of many <i>member DAOs</i>, each of which manages a single
	product or service.

    <p>
        At the start, I hope to onboard Solana DeFi applications as members. Futarchy
        is well-suited to administrate DeFi applications because it is more resistant
        to the <a href="https://dune.com/embeds/675784/1253758">bribing</a> and
        <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/hack-analysis-beanstalk-governance-attack-april-2022-f42788fc821e">governance attacks</a>
        that have plagued token-voting DAOs.
	
    <p>
        From there, who knows? Maybe the Meta-DAO will one day even reach the elusive 
        <a href="https://balajis.com/p/the-network-state-2">network state</a> status. 

    <p>
    	But until then, I will try to keep my nose to the grindstone. After all, 
        code ain't gonna write itself! If you would also like to place your
        nose at the grindstone, perhaps even adjacent to my own, you can reach me
