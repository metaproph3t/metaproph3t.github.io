    <h2>This isn't working</h2>

    <p>
    I've worked in crypto for a while. Nallok, who's become my co-founder at MetaDAO,
    has been in crypto for much longer. We both feel that <i>crypto's current
    way of doing things doesn't work</i>. But don't worry! We've got a master plan
    to save crypto. If we could boil that plan down to a sentence, it would be:
    <b>make crypto more like Silicon Valley</b>. And we're starting with MetaDAO.

    <h3>The three horsemen of the cryptopalypse</h3>

    <p>
    Crypto projects face three big problems:
    <ol>
	    <li>Semi-retirement</li>
	    <li>Short-termism</li>
	    <li>Sales by insiders</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Horseman #1: Semi-retirement</h4>
    <p>
    If you work for a Silicon Valley start-up that starts to suceed, you have
    a strong incentive to make it keep succeeding. For example, if I'm the
    second employee of Uber and I see the value of my options balloon to $50M,
    I'm going to work hard so that Uber can IPO and I can realize my gain.

    <p>
    If I'm the second employee of Compound Labs, on the other hand, the incentive
    just isn't there. Once my tokens vest, I can sell them in the open market
    for cold hard cash. And once that's done, I don't have a strong financial
    incentive for Compound to keep suceeding. If I can liquidate $10M, I've made
    it. And maybe I still want more, but not as badly as I wanted the first $10M.
    So my incentive is eroded.

    <p>
    You can see this dynamic at play when you go to many of the projects that
    had big valuations during DeFi summer. Most of the early insiders have left,
    and those who haven't don't care <i>that much</i> about growing the business.
    They mostly just want to hang out with their DeFi friends.

    <p>
    This is obviously not a recipe for success.

    <h4>Horseman #2: Short-termism</h4>
    <p>
    Historically, the most successful technology companies were staffed by people
    in it for the long haul. Larry and Sergey led Google for 17 years
    before giving up the reins to Sundar. Bezos led Amazon for 25 with a virtually
    untouched management team. Jobs also did 25. Zuckerberg is still at the helm
    of Facebook after 20 years.

    <p>
    This makes sense. Founders and early employees have a stronger incentive to
    improve the firm than appointed CEOs and later employees because they own
    a larger percentage of the outstanding shares. So it's better to keep the
    early people around than to have people continuously joining and leaving.

    <p>
    Most crypto-natives are not in it for the long haul. They want their tokens
    so that they can extract money from retail in a bull market, and then they're
    out. When I worked in Silicon Valley, I once heard a story
    about a company founded in the dot com era where the IPO was planned in the
    founder's living room before even the entity was formed. Since I have been
    here, crypto has been in a continuous dot com era.

    <h4>Horseman #3: Sales by insiders</h4>
    <p>
    A challenger has appeared to the project coin: memecoins. Unlike project
    coins, memecoins don't always have allocations to insiders.
    <a href="https://lfg.jup.ag/wen">Wen</a>, for example, launched with an
    equal distribution to all wallets.

    <p>
    Memecoins are scary to anyone working on a crypto project. Ultimately
    'retail buying our tokens' is the premise that the whole game rests upon.
    Without that, the 100x public-private arbitrage goes away and VC interest
    dries up.

    <p>
    One of the reasons people are flocking to memecoins is because they're less
    -EV than high-FDV low-float tokens that insiders can dump.

    <p>
    In Silicon Valley, this isn't really an issue because insiders are generally
    only allowed to sell their shares (in so-called 'secondaries') once the company
    is more mature and has shown signs of economic sustainability. VCs are generally
    not the exit liquidity, although <a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1547955826488274944">they can be</a>.

    <h3>The solution - no more dumping!</h3>
    <p>
    Maybe you're seeing where this is going. We need
    to make crypto more like Silicon Valley. We need to stop the count dump.

    <p>
    Specifically, we're proposing a structure for MetaDAO that tries to emulate
    Silicon Valley's time-to-liquidity and incentive structure. For contributors,
    it would work as follows:
    <ul>
	    <li>Every quarter, we take a time-weighted average of the META price.
		    The average price during the quarter that you joined is the
		    <i>strike price</i> of your options. If you don't know what
		    a strike price is, you should probably learn a little bit
		    about options, but basically the strike price is the price
		    at which you can buy META from the option.</li>
	    <li>When you join, you agree to an options package with the DAO. Your
		    agreement specifies a number of tokens. At the start, all 
		    of these agreements will be made via governance
		    proposal. For example, I will raise a proposal to pay myself
		    5% of the current META supply in options.</li>
	    <li>The options are locked for 4 years from your start date. They're
		    also vested, paid over the duration of the four years. For
		    example, if my proposal passes, I will have 1.25% of the
		    current META supply in 2028 locked options in one year.
		    They also have a cliff: 4 months for cyber-agents (our equivalent
		    of employees) and 8 months for entrepreneurs (our equivalent
		    of managers).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Basically, I and other insiders won't be able to dump that much. Of course,
    I own some liquid META, but these are less than 1% of the supply and I acquired
    ~half of my stash from buying in the spot market. Nallok and I have both
    basically cucked ourselves: Nallok placed a sell order for all of his META
    at $1 before we had a cancel button and I gave away 2/3rds of my airdrop
    to people I forgot to include in the airdrop script. Which sucks, but is also
    nice because it means that if we become extremely wealthy (and we plan to!
    we are not paupers!) it'll be via the options.
