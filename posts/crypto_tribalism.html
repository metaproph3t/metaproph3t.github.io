    <h2>Why crypto tribalism is gud</h2>

    <p>
        Anyone who's been on CT knows that there's a lot of fighting between
	the different tribes, particularly between the Solana tribe and the
	'Broader Ethereum' tribe. Every once in a while, I'll see some tweet
	to the effect of "can't we all get along?" Well, I'm here to tell you
	that it's <i>good</i> that we don't get along.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="img/pda_r.png" width="500">
    <p>On a typical day, Solana Twitter is abuzz with the virtues of Solana and the
    evils of Ethereum
    </div>

    <p>
    	The thing is, no one <i>really</i> knows what trade-offs will end up
	making sense in the real world. For example, I believe that Solana's
	decision to <a href="https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs">
	require validators to have a fast internet connection</a> makes sense. 
	But if the world's data center operators banded together tmr and decided
	they didn't want crypto stuff running in their centers, that thesis no
	longer makes sense. Not even Vitalik, with his <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/vitalik-buterin/">
	plus-sized brain</a>, knows what the future holds.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="img/vitalik.jpeg" width="300">
    <p>That's right, not even this magnificent creature (I'm not being sarcastic,
    Vitalik is literally magnificent and we all owe a great deal to him) knows
    what's gonna happen
    </div>

    <p>
    	And since noone really knows what decisions will be the right ones, it
	makes sense to try out a bunch of stuff.

    <p>
	The problem is that humans are hard-wired to be conformist. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution">
	A few million years</a> of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201904/why-people-conform">
	getting left behind = certain death</a> tends to do that to you. Left
	to our own devices, we'd probably all consolidate around a single point
	in the blockchain design space and shout down anyone who disagreed.
	That is, until we ended up being wrong about something and fly off the cliff
	together like a bunch of lemmings.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="img/tower_of_babel.jpeg" width="300">

    the same way
    </div>

    <p>
    	Enter tribalism. With tribalism, you conform inwardly with your tribe but
	look down upon members of other tribes. So if you hear that the other
	tribe is zigging, you wanna zag. If the other tribe starts pursuing a
	<a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">
	rollup-centric roadmap</a>, you laugh about how silly rollups are and 
double down on <a href="https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/solana-the-monolith">
	scaling without sharding</a>. The result of this is that we avoid
	putting our eggs in one basket. When a tribe's vision doesn't work out,
	the tribe can disband and its members can join other tribes.

        So yeah, don't listen to those CT accounts who try to convey that they
	are above the petty squabbles of us peasants. Tribalism is gud, and all
	that shit-slinging you do on CT helps contribute to a better, brighter
	future!

    <p>
    	P.S., Ethereum sux! Soylana 4ever!
