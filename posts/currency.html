    <h2>Do we still need currencies?</h2>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
	Over milennia, many gallons of proverbial ink have been spilled over the
	question of money. Some of history's brightest minds have engaged in
	heated debates over topics such as who should control the money supply,
	whether currencies should be inflationary or deflationary, and what, if
	anything, currencies should be backed by.

    <p>
	These haven't been purely the musings of theoreticians, either. They have
	translated into policy actions such as the adoption and subsequent
	abandonment of the gold standard, governments' responses to the Great
	Depression and subsequent recessions, and governments' management of interest
	rates. Although the study of currencies is an abstract discipline, it has
	very real effects, impressing itself upon the lives of billions.

    <p>
	The cryptocurrency movement is a recent attempt to improve the way that
	currencies function. Some members of this movement advocate for a
	<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2021e3.htm">synthetic commodity money</a>,
	like
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">BTC</a>,
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a>,
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">SOL</a>,
	or even <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/">DOGE</a>.
	These proponents

	and

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">too</a>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%93present_Argentine_monetary_crisis">much</a>
	<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">money</a>. 
	This is the thrust behind memes like <a href="https://bitcoinbriefly.com/21-million-bitcoin/">21 million</a>
	and <a href="https://ultrasound.money/">ultra sound money</a>.

	<p>
	Others say that assets like BTC are far too volatile to be used for daily transactions,
	and that that people should instead use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin">stablecoins</a>
	that are either pegged to <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">individual fiat currencies</a>,
	<a href="https://sls.gmu.edu/pfrt/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/LibraWhitePaper_en_US-Rev0723.pdf">a basket of currencies</a>,
	or <a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/">a basket of assets</a>.
	They argue that stablecoins give users the benefits
	of blockchain
	(e.g., instant global payments, DeFi, access to NFTs, etc.) without
	the risk of their savings losing excessive value.

    <p>The price of bitcoins can fluctuate substantially, even over just one week
    </div>

	<p>
	Others are opposed to deflationary assets like BTC for monetary reasons.
	Projects like Freicoin aim to encourage spending, thus bolstering the economy of any
	economy that uses freicoins as a medium of exchange, by making holders pay a 'demurrage fee'
	for holding freicoins.

	<p>
	Recently, I have started to wonder if they are all wrong. What if the problem that
	currencies solve no longer exists in a blockchain-based financial system (which I
	believe will gain traction[link])? What would a world without currencies look like?

    <h3>The currency premise</h3>

	<p>
	Currencies exist as a <i>common ground</i> upon which to conduct commercial and
	financial transactions. If I'm a butcher and I would like to buy bread from the baker,
	I can't just walk in with a slab of meat and expect to walk out with a loaf of bread.
	What if, for example, the baker is a vegetarian?

	<p>
	Of course, it would be great if either of us had a magic machine which instantly
	converted what I have (meat) for whatever the baker wants (say, a cookbook for making
	samosas), but as we don't have that machine, we need to agree on some common thing
	to trade with: a money.

    <p>
	Thus far, this premise has been accepted by the cryptocurrency community. For example,
	the 
	<a href="https://assets.website-files.com/611153e7af981472d8da199c/618b02d13e938ae1f8ad1e45_Terra_White_paper.pdf">Terra Whitepaper</a>
	states:
	<i>"currencies inherently have strong network effects:
	a customer is unlikely to switch over to a new currency unless a critical
	mass of merchants are
	ready to accept it, but at the same time, merchants have no reason to
	invest resources and educate
	staff to accept a new currency unless there is significant customer
	demand for it."</i>

    <h3>DeFi can break this premise</h3>

    <p>
	People use money for a few reasons. For one, it allows them to store
	purchasing power. A baker can sell bread today and buy meat tomorrow. 
	Money also gives people a unit of account in which to price goods and
	investments. 

    <p>
	What if they're all wrong? What if currency doesn't have a future?
	And no, I'm not being provocative for the sake of being provocative.
	Please allow me a brief moment to explain.

    <h3>The general idea</h3>


    <p>
	Or am I? Most debit and credit cards allow you to make free or very cheap
	(~1% fees) international purchases. So someone walking into an American
	supermarket with only Euros (in their bank account) would be okay: Visa or Mastercard
	will <a href="https://www.helcim.com/guides/accepting-international-credit-cards/">convert currencies in the back-end</a>
	so that I can pay in Euros and the merchant can get paid in US Dollars.
	This generalizes to assets stored on blockchains as well.
	<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/card">Coinbase Card</a>, for example,
	allows you to spend using crypto. PayPal
	<a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/pay-with-crypto-using-paypal-heres-how/">allows you to pay with crypto in checkout</a>.
	From a technical implementation perspective, it should be trivial for
	these firms to allow users to pay using other blockchain-based assets.

    <p>
	Now look at an asset class that has
	<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031015/what-history-futures.asp">existed since the 16th centry</a>
	and is <a href="https://blog.landx.fi/landx-roadmap-7f45945ba748">starting to move onto blockchains</a>:
	commodity futures. Commodity futures are simply a way to buy a good
	before that good has been produced. For example, if I am a chicken
	farmer and you are McDonalds,
	<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/how-ray-dalio-helped-launch-mcdonalds-chicken-mcnugget.html">I can pre-sell you a quantity of chickens before I have raised them</a>.

    <p>
	While neither of these above ideas - paying with crypto and commodities
	futures - is particularly exciting by itself, paring them together might
	eliminate the need for money.
