    <h2>Why Ethereum's market position is more fragile than you think</h2>

    <p>
    The year is 2026. All applications and users have finally finished migrating 
    from Ethereum Mainnet to a L2 rollup such as Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync,
    or Scroll. Meanwhile, the price of ETH is plummeting. People are confused.
    This is the future they wanted; why isn't it leading to the outcome they
    wanted? 'Wat mean?' asks
    <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams">@RyanSAdams</a> on XXX (Elon got
    a bit carried away with naming). Well, let me tell you wat mean.

    <h3>Life as pictured through ETH maxi goggles</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../img/eth_goggles.jpeg" width="300">
    <p>"All I see is ETH, ETH everywhere"
    </div>
    <p>
    As detailed in Vitalik's <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">Incomplete Guide to Rollups</a>,
    rollups consume L1 blockspace in three ways:
    <ol>
	    <li>storing state roots</li>
	    <li>publishing transaction calldata</li>
	    <li>(in ZK rollups) on-chain verification of the ZK-SNARK</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    ETH maxis like this because it means that Ethereum users can pay cheaper
    prices without reducing the total amount of ETH burnt. It's like Ethereum
    is an airplane, and the L2 is a magical seating technology that allows
    more seats to fit on the plane. That way, the plane can charge less per
    seat while still making just as much (or more!) money.

    <h3>Back to reality...</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>Reality goggles can be less fun.
    </div>
    <p>
    However, there's a flaw in this logic. By the estimates of Optimism employee Kelvin
    Fichter, 
    <a href="https://kelvinfichter.com/pages/thoughts/tps-is-dumb/">the vast majority of the L2 blockspace consumption comes from publishing transaction calldata</a>.
    What if the so-called rollups decide <i>not</i> to publish this calldata to
    Ethereum? After all, L2s can publish transaction calldata to any storage device that
    their users trust. 

    <p>
    You retort, lips trembling, "they wouldn't possibly think of doing that!
    It would ruin their Eth-alginment!" Well, I think they would. But more
    importantly,
    <a href="https://blog.matter-labs.io/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf">they already have</a>.
    Matter Labs, the company behind zkSync, has proposed their own homegrown
    data availability layer in order to cheapen costs for users. Here's what they
    say about it:

    <p><i>
	    Both parts will be composable and interoperable: contracts and accounts on the zkRollup side will be able to seamlessly interact with accounts on the zkPorter side, and vice versa. That’s right! From a user’s perspective, the only perceptible difference will be a 100x reduction in fees for zkPorter accounts.</i>

    <p>
    Hence, Ethereum blockspace would no longer be enchanted with the magical spell
    of network effects. Instead, they would have to compete for user dollars
    with optimized data availability layers like
    <a href="https://docs.celestia.org/concepts/how-celestia-works/data-availability-layer/">Celestia</a>.
    This is a fight that I think they will lose.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    To be clear, I'm not <i>hoping</i> that Ethereum fails. I trace my own lineage
    back to the Ethereum ecosystem, and there are parts of the culture that I love.
    If the core engineers can execute on
    on <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488">EIP-4488</a> and make Eth
    the best data availability layer the world has ever seen, Ethereum will continue
    to have a big role in the rollup-centric world.

    <p>
    But I also think that we all benefit when the best technology wins. And if
    that best technology happens to be something other than Ethereum, so be it.
