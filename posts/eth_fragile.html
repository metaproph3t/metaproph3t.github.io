    <h2>Why Ethereum's market position is more fragile than you think</h2>

    <p>
    The year is 2026. All applications and users have finally finished migrating 
    from Ethereum Mainnet to a L2 rollup such as Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync,
    or Scroll. Meanwhile, the price of ETH is plummeting. 'Wat mean?' asks
    <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams">@RyanSAdams</a> on XXX (Elon got
    a bit carried away with naming). Well, let me tell you wat mean.

    <h3>Life as pictured through ETH maxi goggles</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../img/eth_goggles.jpeg" width="300">
    <p>"All I see is ETH, ETH everywhere"
    </div>
    <p>
    As detailed in Vitalik's <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">Incomplete Guide to Rollups</a>,
    rollups consume L1 blockspace in three ways:
    <ol>
	    <li>storing state roots</li>
	    <li>publishing transaction calldata</li>
	    <li>(in ZK rollups) on-chain verification of the ZK-SNARK</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    Importantly, for any rollup with non-trivial scale,
    <a href="https://kelvinfichter.com/pages/thoughts/tps-is-dumb/">the vast majority of the L1 gas cost comes from publishing transaction calldata</a>.
    ETH maxis like this because it means that Ethereum users can pay cheaper
    prices without reducing the total amount of ETH that is burnt. It's as if
    Ethereum were an airplane, and the L2 is a type of double-decker seat that
    allows double the number of people to sit in the plane: the plane can charge
    less per customer while still keeping their revenue the same or even increasing it.

    <h3>Back to reality...</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../img/uh_oh.jpeg" width="300">
    <p>Reality goggles can be less fun.
    </div>
    <p>
    But there's a problem in this thinking. What if the so-called rollups decide
    <i>not</i> to publish transaction calldata to Ethereum? After all, the business
    of transaction calldata storage doesn't have network effects. Within a single
    rollup, you could even have users that pay cheaper prices to publish to a
    data availability layer like 
    <a href="https://docs.celestia.org/concepts/how-celestia-works/data-availability-layer/">Celestia</a>
    interact with users who pay more expensive prices to publish a more expensive
    one like Ethereum Mainnet.

    <p>
    But, you say, with your lips trembling, "they wouldn't possibly think of doing
    that! That would ruin their Eth-alignment!" Well,
    <a href="https://blog.matter-labs.io/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf">they already have</a>.
    Matter Labs has proposed zkPorter, their own data availability layer, which
    would obviate the need for publishing transaction calldata to Eth. And, in their
    own words, "Both parts will be composable and interoperable: contracts and accounts on the zkRollup side will be able to seamlessly interact with accounts on the zkPorter side, and vice versa. That’s right! From a user’s perspective, the only perceptible difference will be a 100x reduction in fees for zkPorter accounts."

    <p>
    Now, zkPorter is as of yet not a reality, but we've also been in an environment
    with relatively cheap gas fees. What happens in the next <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/149111/su-zhu-says-his-supercycle-price-thesis-was-regrettably-wrong">Zhupercycle</a>?
    Well, all speculation, but here's my guess:
    <ul>
	    <li>At least one of these rollups start giving the users the option
		    to settle to a cheaper data availability layer</li>
	    <li>Users take that option, despite the pleadings of Eth maxis
		    that this cheaper DA layer is marginally less secure</li>
	    <li>Ethereum Mainnet blockspace starts become more sparse,
		    and burn compresses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    To be clear, this will be good for the entire crypto industry. Ethereum is
    a bloated blockchain that has subsisted by its network effects. We deserve
    to live in an ecosystem that rewards good technology, and not just being
    early.
