    <h2>The fundamentalists and the narrativists</h2>
    <p>
	During my time in crypto, I've come to make a distinction between two
	types of people. I call the first group <i>fundamentalists</i> and the
	second <i>narrativists</i>. 

    <p>
	Based on the names, you might be able to guess what the terms mean.
	<i>Fundamentalists</i> tend to focus on the fundamentals of things.
	<i>Narrativists</i>, on the other hand, are more focused on the thoughts
	of their peers. A fundamentalist investor, for instance, will tend to be
	have investment criteria like whether or not a business will provide
	something that is useful, whether or not the business is defensible,
	and the size of the market. On the other hand, a narrativist investor
	will be more focused on things like whether other investors have
	already invested, whether they can sell the investment to their 
	investment committee (IC), and if they think other investors will follow
	them.

    <p>
	Many of the founders of foundational projects are fundamentalists. I would
	consider Satoshi, Vitalik, and Anatoly fundamentalists. Each gained notoriety
	for solving a real problem that they wanted fixed. For Satoshi,
	this was building a decentralized electronic cash system; for Vitalik,
	this was creating a turing-complete blockchain that could trustlessly
	perform arbitrary state transitions, and for Anatoly this was optimizing
	the validator internals such that a turing-complete blockchain could
	perform state transitions at scale.

    <p>
	A smaller but still sizeable portion of investors are fundamentalists.
	Kyle Samani and Olaf Carlson-Wee are two that come to mind. But most
	are narrativists. This is especially true of the VCs that came to crypto
	in peak hype times, like 2021 and 2017-2018. This is one of the reasons
	why the prices go so high in the good times and so low in the bad times:
	most people are buying or selling not based on fundamental conviction but
	based on the thoughts of their peers.

    <p>
	And almost all of the popular CT accounts are narrativists. For example,
	@cobie, @HsakaTrades, @DegenSpartan, @TrustlessState, and Adam Cochran
	are narrativists.
	
    <p>
	Usually, the
	narrativists want to be perceived as fundamentalists, and so adopt
	messaging strategies to provide cover for narrativist actions. For example,
	whenever I talk to VCs who were optimistic in 2021 but are now pessimistic
	on crypto, they almost never say "other people started being pessimistic,
	so I thought it would be a good idea to be pessimistic too." They say something
	like "the market shrunk" or point to the proverbial "regulatory overhang."
	Most of these pass as almost-truths, which is the point. Of course, they
	don't fool fundamentalists, who in these examples would understand that
	the market that crypto is trying to capture (financial services) is
	still ripe for disruption and that regulation has always been, and will
	always be, a concern in crypto since crypto is fundamentally a subversive
	force. 

    <p>
	Although the fundamentalists don't generally want to be perceived as narrativists,
	some of them do wish to harness the powers of the narrativists. Narrative
	can be incredibly powerful, as discussed in <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resouce is Legitimacy</a>.
	This is one of the primary draws of Twitter: even if you
