    <h2>Getting to Gaia</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
	In Isaac Asimov's sci-fi <i>Foundation</i> series, there is a planet called
	Gaia. From the outside, Gaia looks similar to Earth. Just like Earth, it
	has oceans, land, plants, and all the animals of the animal kingdom, including
	humans. But Gaia is different in one very important way. On Gaia, all
	matter is part of a broader group consciousness.

	<p>
	If an economist were visiting this super-organism, they might make
	the observation that 'on Gaia, all externalities are internalized.'
	That is, Gaians <i>feel</i> the impact of their actions on others. This
	is unlike Earth, where for example Alice may hurt Bob without feeling
	Bob's pain.

	<p>
	And the behavior described by Asimov is exactly what an economist would
	predict: every Gaian takes actions based on whether they will benefit
	Gaia as a whole. { insert passage }

	<p>
	Now, this all may sound very utopian and non-Earthy. After all, us Earthies
	have <i>many</i> situations where we can do something that's good for us
	but bad for others, or vice versa. These are the prisoner's dilemma incentive
	traps taking forms as varied as overfishing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYism</a>,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue#Famous_historical_demagogues">bad policies making for good politics</a>,
	and underallocation of resources into public goods. The cynic may conclude
	"nothing changes, we will forever be doomed to our fate."

	<p>
	The flaw in the cynic's reasoning is that some places on Earth are more
	Gaian than others. Germany, for example, is more Gaian than Somalia.
	While the Germans live in a state of relative peace and prosperity, the
	Somalis live in anarchy and poverty. If we are forever doomed to our fate,
	why have some places figured out how to partially mitigate that fate?

	<p>
	See, although the humans on Earth are psychologically a far cry from
	the humans on Gaia, we have figured out a clever hack to emulate
	the Gaian success: <i>institutions</i>. The difference between Germany
	and Somalia is that Germany has institutions (e.g., property rights,
	the force of law) that encourage its citizens to contribute to overall
	welfare. Someone who might grow up to be a raider or warlord in Somalia
	might become a factory-worker or business owner in Germany.

	<p>
	But, as those who live in the world's wealthiest countries know, we
	still have a <i>long</i> way to go before we reach the Gaian ideal.
	This, in my view, is the central thrust behind the crypto movement.
	That is, <i>crypto exists to provide alternative institutions
	that are more Gaian than present ones</i>. 

	<h3>Crypto exists to provide alternative institutions...</h3>
	<p>
	If we break this claim into two halves, we can start by proving the first:
	that crypto exists to provide alternative institutions. 

	<h4>Crypto produces institutions</h4>
	<p>
	Crypto, unlike many industries, does not produce anything tangible. You
	can't eat blockspace, or use fraud proofs to travel from London to Shanghai,
	or clothe yourself in bitcoins. 

	<p>
	Instead, crypto provides institutions. Some examples include:
	<ul>
		<li>Bitcoin, an institution for money defined by a supply
			cap of 21 million and peer-to-peer management of the ledger.</li>
		<li>Ethereum and Solana, institutions that aim to provide
			'world computers,' highly fault-tolerant and censorship-
			resistant state machines.</li>
		<li>Nouns DAO, an institution built around the idea of a
			community with a treasury funded by new entrants.</li>
		<li>MakerDAO, an institution controlled partly by code and
			partly by the wishes of MKR token-holders that aims
			to provide a decentralized stablecoin.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Some may remark: "these aren't institutions, they're software!" But the
	existence of blockchain forks illustrates that they are, in fact, institutions.
	When the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/history/#dao-fork">DAO fork</a>
	happened, both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic were practically identical
	software. So what made one Ethereum, and one Ethereum Classic? Simply, 
	that we had decided it so. And consequently, while 1 DAI on Ethereum
	was still worth 1 US Dollar, 1 DAI on Ethereum classic was not.
	Code may be a part of our new cybernetic institutions, but it is not the only
	part.

	<h4>The institutions are <b>alternative</b> ones</h4>
	<p>
	Importantly, these are <i>alternative</i> institutions. In other words,
	they hope to co-exist with or replace mainstream institutions, not reform
	them. Bitcoin is not led by central banks nor are DeFi
	protocols led by TradFi firms. 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit%2C_Voice%2C_and_Loyalty">Crypto is exit, not voice</a>.

	<h3>...that are more Gaian than present ones</h3>
	<p>
	This is where some of you might start to disagree with me. In my view,
	crypto doesn't exist in service of abstract ideals like 'freedom' or
	'permissionlessness.' The goal is to build institutions that advance
	the collective welfare of society.

	<h4>The Bitcoin case study</h4>
	<p>
	Bitcoin was the match that lit this fire, so it may be worth considering
	why it was created. Here's Satoshi, in his first post on the Bitcoin forum:
	"The central bank must 
	be trusted not to debase the currency, but <i>the history of fiat currencies is 
	full of breaches of that trust</i>. Banks must be trusted to hold our money 
	and transfer it electronically, but <i>they lend it out in waves of credit 
	bubbles</i> with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with 
	our privacy, trust them <i>not to let identity thieves drain our accounts</i>"
	(italics mine). 

	<p>
	Thus, although the Gospel According to Satoshi was imbued with hints of
	abstract ideals (e.g., privacy), clearly Bitcoin was made to be practical.
	It was made to solve the real problems of <i>currency debasement</i>
	and <i>credit bubbles</i>. Note that in the first Bitcoin block, Satoshi invoked
	'Chancellor on the Brink of Second Bailout for Banks' and not a passage
	from <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>.

	<p>
	<i>This</i> is what makes Bitcoin worth considering. If it were simply
	'anti-AML coin,' it might be interesting to a few drug lords and Ayn
	Rand book clubs. But if an economy run on bitcoins is less susceptible
	to currency debasement and credit bubbles, Bitcoin may bring humanity
	closer to Gaia.

	<p>
	Bitcoin also exemplifies the tools of the typical crypto-institution:
	power structures and incentives. By having the network run by a P2P
	set of nodes, Bitcoin ensures that 'elites' won't be print money for
	private benefit and socialized loss. By using block rewards, Bitcoin
	incentivizes people to contribute to the security and economic finality of
	the ledger.

	<h4>Turing-complete blockchains as the Gaian nursery</h4>
	<p>
	Still, the skeptic may ask, "what role do blockchains have to play in
	this?" Fundamentally, <i>turing-complete blockchains allow institution-designers
	to experiment without asking for permission</i>. 

	<p>
	To demonstrate, let's
	take the example of what I'm working on, <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">futarchy</a>.
	The basic idea of futarchy is to allow markets, instead of individuals,
	to make decisions. So if a corporation was deciding whether to fire
	the CEO, they could run two markets for their stock - 'CEO pass stock'
	and 'CEO fail stock' - and just do whichever ends up with the higher price.
	Now imagine what you would need to do in order to try futarchy in the
	world of legacy institutions. You would first need to hire some expensive
	lawyers to craft a special-purpose operating agreement, then you would
	need to find a government that would allow you to create an
	entity like this, then you would need to convince the local stock market
	to list these special markets, and on and on and on. Meanwhile, I, as
	a solo developer, will have created a futarchic organization on a public
	blockchain (Solana) in a few months of development time. The difference
	is night and day.

	<p>
	The point is not that futarchy will work. Like any experimental project,
	it carries a substantial risk of failure. The point is that such experimental
	projects are not possible in the existing legal / financial system. Instead
	of a small army of lawyers and lobbyists, you only need one programmer
	who wants to see an institution tried.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	All these experiments are likely to lead to many failures. Crypto has
	already had plenty of those, both at a 
	<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-17/mark-cuban-defi-iron-finance-crashed-100">small scale</a>
	and at a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)">large scale</a>.
	We will likely have many more. But in the end, the difference between
	the present-day and a crypto-enabled world could be as big as the difference
	between Somalia and Germany. I think it'll have been worth it.
