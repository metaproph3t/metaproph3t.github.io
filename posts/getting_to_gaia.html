    <h2>Getting to Gaia</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
	In Isaac Asimov's <i>Foundation</i> series, there is a planet called
	Gaia. On Gaia, everyone is part of a singular group consciousness.
	It is therefore meaningless to speak of 'Gaians' - there is only Gaia,
	with its many organs taking the form of birds, bugs, trees, and humans.

	<p>
	In an economist's eyes, this planet has an interesting property: all
	externalities are internalized. That is, when a human hurts another
	human, they feel their pain as it is their own. On the flipside, when
	someone makes another person happy, they get to share in that happiness.
	The result of this is that <i>every action is taken based on whether
	it benefits Gaia as a whole</i>. Prisoner's dilemma
	incentive traps, rampant on Earth in forms as varied as overfishing,
	NIMBYism, bad policies making for good politics, and underallocation
	of resources into public goods, don't exist on Gaia.

	<p>
	A few days ago on our home planet of Earth, Erik Voorhees gave a talk
	entitled 'Why are we here?' in which he laid out his views on what
	exactly the crypto movement is providing for humanity. His principal
	claim is that we are here to bring about more freedom and permissionless-ness
	for humanity. 

	<p>
	As well-spoken as his speech was, I have a different view on why we are
	here. My view is that <i>crypto exists to provide alternative institutions
	that are more Gaia-like than present ones</i>. 

	<h3>Crypto exists to provide alternative institutions...</h3>
	<p>
	If we break this claim into two halves, we can start by proving the first:
	that crypto exists to provide alternative institutions. 

	<p>
	Crypto, unlike many industries, does not produce anything tangible. You
	can't eat blockspace, or use fraud proofs to travel from London to Shanghai,
	or clothe yourself in bitcoins. Neither does crypto provide information
	or allow you to efficiently store it - you can't use it to find 
	barbers in your area and it is <i>not</i> recommended that
	you use it as a drop-in replacement for MySQL. 

	<p>
	Instead, crypto provides
	institutions. Bitcoin is an institution for money defined by a supply
	cap of 21 million and peer-to-peer management of the ledger. Ethereum
	and Solana are institutions that aim to provide highly fault-tolerant
	and censorship-resistant state machines - 'world computers.' Nouns DAO
	is an institution built around the idea of cultural influence. 
	
	<p>
	Importantly, these are <i>alternative</i> institutions. That is, they
	aim to co-exist with or replace mainstream institutions, like banks,
	corporations, and nation-states. They generally <i>do not</i> attempt
	to reform those institutions. In the mental model of 'voice vs. exit,'
	crypto is exit. Although there have been some attempts to get legacy
	institutions involved in crypto and blockchains, most have either not
	worked or are currently flailing. Think Hyperledger Fabric, Hedera
	Hashgraph, and Ripple.

	<h3>...that are more Gaia-like than present ones</h3>
	<p>
	The goal is not simply to build alternative institutions for the sake
	of it, but to build <i>better</i> ones. Ones that allow us to get closer
	to the Gaian ideal.

	<p>
	Here's Satoshi in his first post on Bitcointalk: "The central bank must 
	be trusted not to debase the currency, but <i>the history of fiat currencies is 
	full of breaches of that trust</i>. Banks must be trusted to hold our money 
	and transfer it electronically, but <i>they lend it out in waves of credit 
	bubbles</i> with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with 
	our privacy, trust them <i>not to let identity thieves drain our accounts</i>"
	(italics mine). 

	<p>
	Evidently, Bitcoin was made to be practical. It wasn't
	about "the chains of the state" as much as it was about "here's a real
	problem with money, here's a solution." Importantly, the first Bitcoin
	block contained 'Chancellor on the brink of second round of bailouts'
	and not a passage from <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>. If Bitcoin was merely
	a less-permissioned money, with no practical benefits to society, it might
	have adopters among the world's drug markets and Ayn Rand book clubs,
	but it wouldn't be particularly interesting. What makes Bitcoin interesting
	is that legacy money institutions have a long history of hurting people,
	and that Bitcoin could take away their power.
	
	<p>
	What does this all have to do with Gaia? Well, on Gaia, every person
	takes actions based on how they will impact the world as a whole.
	Since humans on Earth have been trained by millions of years of natural
	selection to not think this way, all we can do is try to <i>emulate</i>
	the Gaian ideal. 

	<p>
	For example, we can incentivize people to do socially-beneficial
	things, so that greed leads to good. We can also change the way that
	power is allocated. Most crypto-institutions use a combination of these
	two in order to achive their goals. For example, Bitcoin allocates
	power to its users to solve the aforemention problems with centralized
	control over money supply and incentivizes network security 
	(concretely, the money working) via block rewards.

	<p>
	While changing power and incentive structures sounds somewhat removed
	from reality, power and incentive structures are the main thing separating
	the prosperous Western world and the less-prosperous countries, such as
	those in Africa. In order to become very rich
	in Swaziland, one must befriend the king; in order to become very rich in
	America, one must solve a big problem for millions of people. This,
	and not other less important factors like culture, is why Swaziland
	founders while America prospers. The difference between a the present-day
	and a crypto-enabled world may be just as big as the difference between
	Swaziland and the West.

	<h3>We have strayed from the path and need to re-find our way</h3>
	<p>
	It has beeen 14 years since crypto Bitcoin was invented. To show for it,
	we have stablecoins that you can send instantly around the world, we
	have financial primitives that could lay the bedrock of a future financial
	system, and we have green shoots when it comes to RWAs and RWA adoption.
	So far, very few people are benefitting from crypto. Crypto has also
	produced many socially-destructive things like UST (the cause of
	multiple suicides), facilitating money laundering for a rogue state
	that's building up a nuclear arsenal, and plenty of outright scams and
	ponzi schemes.

	<p>
	My point in this is not to doubt crypto. I am extremely bullish
	on crypto - particularly DeFi. The Solana community is a bright spot
	among crypto-at-large as having a particular focus on use-cases that
	matter. But it is clear that crypto as a whole needs to do some soul-searching.
	Will we continue to allocate our attention
	and resources towards projects that simply transfer wealth around, like
	friend.tech? Or will we allocate more towards the projects that attempt
	to bring human civilization closer to Gaia?
