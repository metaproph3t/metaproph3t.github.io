    <h2>Getting to Gaia</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <blockquote>
	<p>&ensp;"And then we can be taken to whoever it is that you speak of as Gaia?" said Trevize.
	<p>&ensp;Bliss looked amused. "I don't know if you're going to believe this, Trev. <i>I'm</i> Gaia.
	<p>&ensp;Trevize stared. He had often heard the phrase, "collect one's thoughts" used metaphorically. For the first time in his life, he felt as though he were engaged in the process literally. Finally he said, "<i>You?</i>"
	<p>&ensp;"Yes. And the ground. And those trees. And that rabbit over there in the grass.
	And the man you can see through the trees. The whole planet and everything
	on it is Gaia. We're all individuals—we're all separate organisms—but
	we all share an overall consciousness. The inanimate planet does so least of all,
	the various forms of life to a varying degree, and human beings most of all—but
	we all share."
	<p>&ensp;Pelorat said, "I think, Trevize, that she means Gaia is some sort of
	group consciousness."
	<p>&ensp;Trevize nodded. "I gathered that. —In that case, Bliss, who runs this
	world?"
	<p>&ensp;Bliss said, "It runs itself. Those trees grow in rank and file of
	their own accord. They multiply only to the extent that is needed to replace
	those that for any reason die. Human beings harvest the apples that are
	needed; other animals, including insects, eat their share—and only their
	share."
	<p><i>Foundation's Edge</i>, Isaac Asimov
    </blockquote>
    	<p>
	How would you like to be part of such a planet? If you're like me,
	the thought of merging your identity with everyone else's makes you squeamish. 
	Most of us like the idea of being
	separate individuals, free to make our own decisions.

	<p>
	Well, I have some relieving news: unless there's a development in psychology
	that I'm not aware of, us Earthies <i>are not</i> on the path to group
	consciousness.

	<p>
	But even if we don't want to become Gaia, I think we can all admit that
	Gaia has some nice properties. For example, because everyone's interests
	are merged, Gaia will never have problems like
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYism</a>,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue#Famous_historical_demagogues">bad policies making for good politics</a>,
	or underallocation of resources into <a href="https://metaproph3t.github.io/posts/public_goods.html">public goods</a>.
	In general, we can say that Gaia doesn't suffer prisoner's dilemma incentive
	traps: people doing things that are
	<a href="https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-1-a8657562b12e">globally harmful because they are locally beneficial</a>.

	<p>
	And although at first glance Gaia seems very utopian and non-Earthy,
	things start to get interesting once you realize that <i>some places
	are more Gaian than others</i>. Germany, for example, is more Gaiain
	than Somalia. While Germany is peaceful and most people are employed
	in the production of goods and providing of useful services, 
	Somalia is <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/somalia#218d3b">chaotic and violent</a>,
	with many people employed in globally harmful activities like piracy
	and raiding. Why is this so? Do the Germans carry
	a 'conscientious gene' that allows them to partake in a sort of group
	consciousness?

	<p>
	Well, no. See, although the humans on Earth are psychologically a far cry from
	the humans on Gaia, we have figured out a clever hack to emulate
	the Gaian success: <i>institutions</i>. The difference between Germany
	and Somalia is that Germany has institutions (e.g., property rights,
	the force of law) that incentivize its citizens to contribute to overall
	welfare, whereas Somalia does not.
	
	<p>
	But, as those who live in the world's wealthiest countries know, we
	still have a <i>long</i> way to go before we reach the Gaian ideal.
	This, in my view, is the central thrust behind the crypto movement.
	That is, <i>crypto exists to provide alternative institutions
	that are more Gaian than present ones</i>. 

	<h3>Crypto exists to provide alternative institutions...</h3>
	<p>
	If we break this claim into two halves, we can start by proving the first:
	that crypto exists to provide alternative institutions. 

	<h4>Crypto produces institutions</h4>
	<p>
	Crypto, unlike many industries, does not produce anything tangible. You
	can't eat blockspace, or use fraud proofs to travel from London to Shanghai,
	or clothe yourself in bitcoins. 

	<p>
	Instead, crypto provides institutions. Some examples include:
	<ul>
		<li>Bitcoin, an institution for money defined by a supply
			cap of 21 million and peer-to-peer management of the ledger.</li>
		<li>Ethereum and Solana, institutions that aim to provide
			'world computers,' highly fault-tolerant and censorship-
			resistant state machines.</li>
		<li>Nouns DAO, an institution built around the idea of a
			community with a treasury funded by new entrants.</li>
		<li>MakerDAO, an institution controlled partly by code and
			partly by the wishes of MKR token-holders that aims
			to provide a decentralized stablecoin.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Some may remark: "these aren't institutions, they're software!" But the
	existence of blockchain forks illustrates that they are, in fact, institutions.
	When the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/history/#dao-fork">DAO fork</a>
	happened, both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic were practically identical
	software. So what made one Ethereum, and one Ethereum Classic? Simply, 
	that we had decided it so. And consequently, while 1 DAI on Ethereum
	was still worth 1 US Dollar, 1 DAI on Ethereum classic was not.
	Code may be a part of our new cybernetic institutions, but it is not the only
	part.

	<h4>The institutions are <b>alternative</b> ones</h4>
	<p>
	Importantly, these are <i>alternative</i> institutions. In other words,
	they hope to co-exist with or replace mainstream institutions, not reform
	them. Bitcoin is not led by central banks nor are DeFi
	protocols led by TradFi firms. 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit%2C_Voice%2C_and_Loyalty">Crypto is exit, not voice</a>.

	<h3>...that are more Gaian than present ones</h3>
	<p>
	This is where some of you might start to disagree with me. In my view,
	crypto doesn't exist in service of abstract ideals like 'freedom' or
	'permissionlessness.' The goal is to build institutions that advance
	the collective welfare of society.

	<h4>The Bitcoin case study</h4>
	<p>
	Bitcoin was the match that lit this fire, so it may be worth considering
	why it was created. Here's Satoshi, in his first post on the Bitcoin forum:
	"The central bank must 
	be trusted not to debase the currency, but <i>the history of fiat currencies is 
	full of breaches of that trust</i>. Banks must be trusted to hold our money 
	and transfer it electronically, but <i>they lend it out in waves of credit 
	bubbles</i> with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with 
	our privacy, trust them <i>not to let identity thieves drain our accounts</i>"
	(italics mine). 

	<p>
	Thus, although the Gospel According to Satoshi was imbued with hints of
	abstract ideals (e.g., privacy), clearly Bitcoin was made to be practical.
	It was made to solve the real problems of <i>currency debasement</i>
	and <i>credit bubbles</i>. Note that in the first Bitcoin block, Satoshi invoked
	'Chancellor on the Brink of Second Bailout for Banks' and not a passage
	from <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>.

	<p>
	<i>This</i> is what makes Bitcoin worth considering. If it were simply
	'anti-AML coin,' it might be interesting to a few drug lords and Ayn
	Rand book clubs. But if an economy run on bitcoins is less susceptible
	to currency debasement and credit bubbles, Bitcoin may bring humanity
	closer to Gaia.

	<p>
	Bitcoin also exemplifies the tools of the typical crypto-institution:
	power structures and incentives. By having the network run by a P2P
	set of nodes, Bitcoin ensures that 'elites' won't be print money for
	private benefit and socialized loss. By using block rewards, Bitcoin
	incentivizes people to contribute to the security and economic finality of
	the ledger.

	<h4>Turing-complete blockchains as the Gaian nursery</h4>
	<p>
	Still, the skeptic may ask, "what role do blockchains have to play in
	this?" Fundamentally, <i>turing-complete blockchains allow institution-designers
	to experiment without asking for permission</i>. 

	<p>
	To demonstrate, let's
	take the example of what I'm working on, <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">futarchy</a>.
	The basic idea of futarchy is to allow markets, instead of individuals,
	to make decisions. So if a corporation was deciding whether to fire
	the CEO, they could run two markets for their stock - 'CEO pass stock'
	and 'CEO fail stock' - and just do whichever ends up with the higher price.
	Now imagine what you would need to do in order to try futarchy in the
	world of legacy institutions. You would first need to hire some expensive
	lawyers to craft a special-purpose operating agreement, then you would
	need to find a government that would allow you to create an
	entity like this, then you would need to convince the local stock market
	to list these special markets, and on and on and on. Meanwhile, I, as
	a solo developer, will have created a futarchic organization on a public
	blockchain (Solana) in a few months of development time. The difference
	is night and day.

	<p>
	The point is not that futarchy will work. Like any experimental project,
	it carries a substantial risk of failure. The point is that such experimental
	projects are not possible in the existing legal / financial system. Instead
	of a small army of lawyers and lobbyists, you only need one programmer
	who wants to see an institution tried.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	All these experiments are likely to lead to many failures. Crypto has
	already had plenty of those, both at a 
	<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-17/mark-cuban-defi-iron-finance-crashed-100">small scale</a>
	and at a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)">large scale</a>.
	We will likely have many more. But in the end, the difference between
	the present-day and a crypto-enabled world could be as big as the difference
	between Somalia and Germany. I think it'll have been worth it.
