    <h2>Getting to Gaia</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
	In Isaac Asimov's <i>Foundation</i> series, there is a planet called
	Gaia. On Gaia, everyone is part of a singular group consciousness.
	The birds, the bugs, the trees, and the humans are mere organs of a
	larger organism. 

	<p>
	Gaia has an interesting economic property: all externalities are
	internalized. Unlike Earth, where it is perfectly possible for a human
	to ignore their impact on other people, Gaiains <i>feel</i> their impact
	on other people. If a Gaian does something that benefits other Gaians,
	they reap that full benefit. Inversely, if a Gaian does something that
	hurts other Gaians, they feel the full brunt of the pain they have caused.

	<p>
	And the behavior described by Asimov is exactly what an economist would
	predict: every Gaian takes actions based on whether they will benefit
	Gaia as a whole. { insert passage }

	<p>
	Now, this all may sound very utopian and non-Earthy. After all, we have
	<i>plenty</i> of prisoner's dilemma incentive traps that we fall into.
	We have overfishing, NIMBYism, bad policies making for good politics,
	and underallocation of resources into public goods. You may conclude from
	this that us Earthies are doomed to our fate of constant fighting, theft,
	and politicking. After all, our psychology is unlikely to change, given
	that it has formed via millions of years of evolution.

	<p>
	The flaw in this reasoning is that we <i>do</i> have some places that
	are more Gaian than others. Although Germany, for example, might not
	be perfectly Gaian, I think we can all agree that it is more Gaian
	than, say, Somalia. Is this because Germans are intrinsically superior
	to Somalians? Does Germany contain more Ãœbermenschs, as Hitler thought?

	<p>
	Well, no. See, even though humans are psychologically a far cry from
	the Gaiains, we have figured out a clever hack to emulate the Gaian
	success: institutions. Germany is more prosperous because its institutions
	encourage people to contribute to general wellfare more often than
	in Somalia. You can't become wealthy by becoming a German warlord, for
	example.

	<p>
	This brings us to the topic of today's discussion: why we need crypto.
	I think this is an important one, given that many people are currently
	jaded on crypto's ability to provide anything that benefits humanity.
	My view is that <i>crypto exists to provide alternative institutions
	that are more Gaian than present ones</i>. I will devote the remainder
	of the essay to proving this claim.

	<h3>Crypto exists to provide alternative institutions...</h3>
	<p>
	If we break this claim into two halves, we can start by proving the first:
	that crypto exists to provide alternative institutions. 

	<p>
	Crypto, unlike many industries, does not produce anything tangible. You
	can't eat blockspace, or use fraud proofs to travel from London to Shanghai,
	or clothe yourself in bitcoins. 

	<p>
	Instead, crypto provides institutions. Some examples include:
	<ul>
		<li>Bitcoin, an institution for money defined by a supply
			cap of 21 million and peer-to-peer management of the ledger.</li>
		<li>Ethereum and Solana, institutions that aim to provide
			'world computers,' highly fault-tolerant and censorship-
			resistant state machines.</li>
		<li>Nouns DAO, an institution built around the idea of a
			community with a treasury funded by new entrants.</li>
		<li>MakerDAO, an institution controlled partly by code and
			partly by the wishes of MKR token-holders that aims
			to provide a decentralized stablecoin.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Now, some may remark: "these aren't institutions, they're software!"
	But consider the case of the MakerDAO-deployed smart contracts on the
	<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-pow/">Ethereum
	Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> chain. These contracts have the same code as
	that of Ethereum mainnet. And yet 1 DAI on EthereumPoW is not redeemable
	for 1 US Dollar. As the saying goes, "it all boils down to social consensus."
	Code may be a part of our cybernetic institutions, but it is not the only
	part.

	<p>
	Importantly, these are <i>alternative</i> institutions. They aim to
	co-exist with or replace mainstream institutions, not reform them.
	Although some projects have tried to 'put the existing world on
	blockchain rails,' like Hyperledger Fabric, most have failed or are
	failing.

	<h3>...that are more Gaian than present ones</h3>
	<p>
	The goal is not simply to build alternative institutions for the sake
	of it, but to build <i>better</i> ones. Ones that allow us to get closer
	to the Gaian ideal.

	<p>
	Here's Satoshi in his first post on Bitcointalk: "The central bank must 
	be trusted not to debase the currency, but <i>the history of fiat currencies is 
	full of breaches of that trust</i>. Banks must be trusted to hold our money 
	and transfer it electronically, but <i>they lend it out in waves of credit 
	bubbles</i> with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with 
	our privacy, trust them <i>not to let identity thieves drain our accounts</i>"
	(italics mine). 

	<p>
	Evidently, Bitcoin was made to be practical. It wasn't
	about "the chains of the state" as much as it was about "here's a real
	problem with money, here's a solution." Importantly, the first Bitcoin
	block contained 'Chancellor on the brink of second round of bailouts'
	and not a passage from <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>. If Bitcoin was merely
	a less-permissioned money, with no practical benefits to society, it might
	have adopters among the world's drug markets and Ayn Rand book clubs,
	but it wouldn't be particularly interesting. What makes Bitcoin interesting
	is that legacy money institutions have a long history of hurting people,
	and that Bitcoin could take away their power.
	
	<p>
	What does this all have to do with Gaia? Well, on Gaia, every person
	takes actions based on how they will impact the world as a whole.
	Since humans on Earth have been trained by millions of years of natural
	selection to not think this way, all we can do is try to <i>emulate</i>
	the Gaian ideal. 

	<p>
	For example, we can incentivize people to do socially-beneficial
	things, so that greed leads to good. We can also change the way that
	power is allocated. Most crypto-institutions use a combination of these
	two in order to achive their goals. For example, Bitcoin allocates
	power to its users to solve the aforemention problems with centralized
	control over money supply and incentivizes network security 
	(concretely, the money working) via block rewards.

	<p>
	While changing power and incentive structures sounds somewhat removed
	from reality, power and incentive structures are the main thing separating
	the prosperous Western world and the less-prosperous countries, such as
	those in Africa. In order to become very rich
	in Swaziland, one must befriend the king; in order to become very rich in
	America, one must solve a big problem for millions of people. This,
	and not other less important factors like culture, is why Swaziland
	founders while America prospers. The difference between the present-day
	world and one that is closer to Gaia may be just as big as the difference 
	between Swaziland and the West.
