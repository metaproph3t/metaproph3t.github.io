    <h2>Why the number of full nodes doesn't affect decentralization</h2>

    <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p>
	In <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html#its-crucial-for-blockchain-decentralization-for-regular-users-to-be-able-to-run-a-node">The Limits to Blockchain Scalability</a>,
	Vitalik discusses why he thinks it's crucial for regular users to be able
	to run a node. Basically, his argument is that regular users verifying 
	the chain is what keeps validators from introducing invalid state transitions.
	I think this logic is flawed for a few reasons described in this post.

    <h3>Verification of state transitions doesn't matter unless it intermediates access</h3>

    <p>
	Imagine for a second that the recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims">whistleblower claims</a>
	are true and that aliens really do exist on Earth. Now imagine that these
	aliens had, unbeknownst to us, been validating the Ethereum blockchain.
	Each block, they download all the block's transactions, apply them to
	their own copy of the state, and make sure that everything checks out.
	Are these aliens helping secure Ethereum against an attack like the one
	Vitalik describes?

    <p>
	Obviously, no, they are not. Although they are validating blocks, no
	(human) users are using this block validation to determine whether a
	chain is valid. A colluding group of validators could just as easily
	pull the wool over their eyes with an invalid block. In other words,
	<i>verification of state transitions only matters insofar as it intermediates
	user access</i>.

    <h3>In reality, users <i>are not</i> intermediating access with full nodes</h3>

    <p>
	<a href="https://www.ethernodes.org/">Ethernodes</a> lists 6,720 distinct
	Ethereum nodes. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/metamask-parent-company-consensys-raises-series-d-at-7b-valuation/">this TechCrunch article</a>, MetaMask has surpassed 30
	million monthly active users (MAUs). This means that even if every 
	single node operator was using their node to intermediate access to
	Ethereum, only 0.02% of users are accessing Ethereum via their own full node.
	The remaining 99.98% of users are trusting someone else to verify the
	chain on their behalf, like <a href="https://www.infura.io/">Infura</a>,
	<a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>, or <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>.

    Coast of the United States is Ashburn, VA, where Amazon has a data center.
    </div>

    <p>
	In my view, this means that there is <i>practically no benefit of
	lessening hardware requirements such that regular users can run nodes</i>.
	The vast majority aren't going to validate anyway, so hardware requirements
	just need to be low enough that crypto service providers (exchanges, RPC providers,
	payment processors, etc.) can run nodes. 
	
    <h3>So what does matter for decentralization?</h3>

    <p>
	I don't want this post to get unwieldy, so I'll briefly list the
	things that <i>do</i> matter for decentralization:
	<ul>
	    <li>Light / diet clients, which prevent a rogue RPC from tricking
		users</li>
	    <li>Fraud proofs, which prevent an attack like the one Vitalik described
		by giving an alarm system to light clients</li>
	    <li>Stake dispersion (a.k.a. having a high <a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e">Nakamoto Coefficient</a>), which makes attacks hard by increasing the threshold
		of nodes that would need to collude to attempt an attack</li>
