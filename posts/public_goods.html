    <h2>WTF is a public good?</h2>
    <p>
    	We hear a lot of people in the cryptocurrency community talking about 
	'public goods.' I estimate that 10% of these people understand what
	the term means.

        good stuff.

    <p>
        Now, if you want the formal definition of a public good,
        you can check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">the Wikipedia page</a>.
        What I'm going to give you is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy#Example:_Suspicious_coin">Fat Tony</a>
        definition. It won't help you publish in a peer-reviewed journal, but
        it may help you understand the world!

    <p>
        A <i>good</i> is anything that provides value to anyone. It could be
        a packet of crisps, a medicine that cures cancer, or a public park.
        As long as it provides those proverbial <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/utile">utiles</a>,
        it fits the definition.

    <p>
        Whether or not a good is <i>public</i> or <i>private</i> depends on where
        those utiles flow. Specifically, <i>a good is public if a large portion
        of its value flows to people other than its creator or maintainer.</i>
        For example, imagine that Bob cooks a pizza. If he eats that pizza all
        by himself, all of the utiles flow to him, and the pizza is a private
        good. If instead a team of pizza burglars break into Bob's house and
        steals the pizza, the pizza ends up as a public good.

    <p>
        But yeah, it's more of a spectrum than a binary on/off switch. Open-source
        software is often used as an example of a public good, which is a fair
        characterization because most of the value of a software libary flows to
        its consumers, not its contributors / maintainers. But contributors can
        expect some benefits too! Like
        <a href="https://www.celential.ai/blog/sourcing-on-github/">improved job prospects</a>, 
        <a href="https://opensource.com/article/21/4/motivates-open-source-contributors">
        a feeling of kinship, and increased reputation</a>

    <p>
        So that's it! You now understand what a public good is! 
        
    <p>
        What's neat about this mental model is that it helps you predict what
        goods will be over-produced and under-produced. For example, DeFi applications
        are closer to public goods because their ability to monetize is unclear.
        So we would expect them to be under-produced relative to infra companies,
        which are closer to private goods because they can charge fees and have
        some degree of lock-in. And sure enough...
